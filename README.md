# Diversify

### Inspiration

Diversify is a Spotify Analytics Web App that allows one to view all their music data and get to know information about their top songs/artists, listening habits, how "basic" their music taste is and even generating new music based on personal interests.

Through years of using Spotify as my favourite music streaming platform and loving the concept of the "year wrapped" I wanted to make something similar that allowed people to see their data at all times. I also wanted to compare my top music choices with that of the top songs in a particular year to see how I matched up. 

### Built With

Flask - Used for creating web server to build the app
Python (Requests) - Used for sending requests to the Spotify Web API for retrieving user data
Pandas - Used for data analysis and calculating various values such as the user's basic score, their lisenting habits etc.
Azure - Used for performing Sentiment Analysis on the user's song lyrics
